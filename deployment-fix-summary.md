# Deployment Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix deployment issues and ensure the application works correctly with the custom domain nomadaiengine.com.

## Key Issues Fixed

1. **Path Reference Error in client/index.html**
   - Problem: The client's index.html was using an absolute path (`/src/main.tsx`) which caused Vite pre-transform errors
   - Solution: Changed to relative path (`./src/main.tsx`) to ensure correct file resolution

2. **Port Configuration Issues**
   - Problem: The server was using a hardcoded port instead of respecting the `process.env.PORT` environment variable
   - Solution: Updated server configuration to prioritize `process.env.PORT` which is essential for Replit deployments

3. **Root Route Handling Issues**
   - Problem: The root route wasn't being properly handled, which could cause 502 errors with custom domains
   - Solution: Added a dedicated root route handler at the top of the middleware stack that:
     - First checks for a production frontend build to serve
     - If no build is found, responds with a formatted JSON response for API requests
     - Provides a fallback HTML page for browser requests if the frontend build isn't available

4. **Static File Serving Issues**
   - Problem: The frontend files weren't being correctly found in production mode
   - Solution: Updated the root route handler to check multiple possible build directories, making it more robust
   
5. **Middleware Order Issues**
   - Problem: Vite middleware was intercepting routes before our API handlers could process them
   - Solution: Rearranged middleware registration order to ensure API routes take precedence

## Production Build Checklist

To ensure the frontend application is properly displayed (and not the fallback page):

1. Make sure `NODE_ENV=production` is set in your deployment environment
2. Run the build process using our updated `build.sh` script
3. Verify that the built files exist in either:
   - `dist/public/index.html` (primary location from vite.config.ts)
   - `client/dist/index.html` (alternative location)
4. Check server logs at startup for which location is being used

## Implementation Details

### 1. Root Route Handler
Added a robust root route handler at the beginning of the Express application configuration:
```javascript
// Root route handler - defined before any middleware
app.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
  // Only handle root route if it's the exact match
  if (req.path !== '/') {
    return next();
  }
  
  if (req.headers.accept && req.headers.accept.includes('text/html')) {
    // For HTML requests, serve a simple HTML page with links to API endpoints
    const html = `
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html lang="en">
      <!-- HTML fallback content -->
      </html>
    `;
    return res.type('html').send(html);
  } else {
    // For API clients or other non-HTML requests
    return res.json({
      app: 'NOMAD AI Engine',
      status: 'running',
      /* Other status information */
    });
  }
});
```

### 2. Port Configuration
Updated server initialization to properly respect the PORT environment variable:
```javascript
// Always use PORT environment variable when available (critical for Replit deployment)
const PORT = process.env.PORT ? parseInt(process.env.PORT, 10) : 5000;
console.log(`Using PORT=${PORT} (from env: ${process.env.PORT || 'not set'})`);
server.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  // Startup code
});
```

### 3. Client Path Reference
Fixed the path reference in `client/index.html` from `/src/main.tsx` to `./src/main.tsx` to use a relative path.

## Testing
The changes were tested using:
- Direct curl requests to the root endpoint with different Accept headers
- Verification of proper port binding
- Checking both JSON and HTML responses

## Deployment Recommendations
For successful deployment:
1. Use the included build script (`build.sh`) which properly sequences client and server builds
2. Set NODE_ENV=production for the run command
3. Ensure all environment variables (especially API keys) are properly configured
4. Verify that PORT environment variable is correctly set by the hosting platform
